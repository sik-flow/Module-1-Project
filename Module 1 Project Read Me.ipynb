    "I decided to use the data given, as well as take advantage of the python library, \"Beautiful Soup\", to webscrape important pieces of information from imdb.com that would serve to be beneficial to Microsoft. From information on budgets, runtimes, ratings, I was able to put together an array of information on who Microsoft should get in touch with, and what they generally should or shouldn't do when making their break into the movie industry. In the first section of this document, the code provided by Flatiron will be analyzed, while the data in the second part will be coming from imdb.com directly.\n",

As the below graph shows, films that invest more in their movies are more likely to get generate higher amounts of revenue. This can also be attributed to the fact that movies with higher budgets usually will allocate some of this money towards advertising, and in turn more people will end coming to the movies to see it."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "After analysis of the given data, as well as data analyzed through BeautifulSoup, there are a few assumptions that can be made. First of all, Microsoft should er on the side of producing a movie rated PG-13, or R, as these ratings accounted for a large majority of the most popular movies examined. The runtime of the movie should be around 120 minutes, but there shouldn't be that much worry if it goes over. Microsoft would be best off producing an action, adventure, or drama movie as these were the most popular genres of the top 100 rated movies (Flatiron Data). There also shouldn't be too much worry on spending a large chunk of money during the production process, as the data suggested that the more movies invest in themselves the more revenue they usually tend to recieve. Lastly, movies such as Mad Max, Paranormal Activity 4, The Gallows, and The Blair Witch Project should all be watched and studied to see how they all made over 400 times the money they invested in the production process.
